        <p>My name is Ren and I am 17 years old. I came to New York City when I was 4 years old and I lived in Chinatown, Manhattan for 6 years. Currently I live in Sunset Park, Brooklyn with my parents and siblings. I like to listen to music and watch TV shows in my spare time. Other times, I like to stare out the windows, hang out with my friends, and or go shopping (I like to go outside).  </p>

        <p>I am also a rising senior attending Manhattan Early College School for Advertising (MECA), being a student at MECA has given me many privileges. I was offered the opportunity to take college courses for free, career technical education class (CTE), and internships. So far I’ve completed 4 college courses (3 college credits each course) and two CTE classes. In addition, I’ve done two internships and they are Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) Summer Bridge 2020 and Work Learn & Grow (WLG). As of right now, I am taking Business for my college course and Branding and Marketing for my CTE class. </p>

        <p>For my career, I want to do something related to design, law, and or teaching. I am not sure what career I want to pursue yet, but I know I want to pursue in a career that I enjoy. I don’t want to pursue a career that my parents want me to do because I don’t want to regret it later on. I want to try out all the careers that I am interested in first before deciding on choosing a career path. I know that life is never easy and is always full of challenges. However, I will not give up on myself and I will continue to work harder. Basically, I want to strive for a happy life. </p>
